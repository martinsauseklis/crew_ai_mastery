- Self-reinforcing cycle where components feed each other
- Knowledge Acquisition feeds Pattern Recognition feeds Prototyping feeds Value Measurement feeds Knowledge Sharing feeds Reputation feeds back to Knowledge Acquisition
- Compounding by design: Month 6 enables 10x opportunity ID, 60% dev time reduction, reputation attracts high-impact projects
- Meta-level: Frameworks generate frameworks (Pattern Library creates solution templates)

**2. 30-Day Quick-Start Despite Complexity**
- Week 1: Infrastructure setup (4h), Opportunity reconnaissance (6h)
- Week 2: MVP scoping (8h) with IDEAL-SCALE evaluation
- Week 3-4: Build and demonstrate (12h) with stakeholder presentation
- Progressive disclosure - can start without understanding full framework
- Clear expected outcomes at each week

**3. Pattern Recognition Framework**
- Three categories: Process Inefficiency, Knowledge Access, Decision Quality
- Each pattern: Signature, context examples, AI solution template, ROI formula, implementation time, reusable components
- Usage protocol: Describe pain, search patterns, adapt template, estimate ROI, validate, evaluate
- Compounds to 15-20 patterns by Month 6, enabling 80% faster opportunity ID

**4. Knowledge Acquisition System**
- Four-tier model: Foundation (20%), Research (30%), Practice (40%), Trends (10%)
