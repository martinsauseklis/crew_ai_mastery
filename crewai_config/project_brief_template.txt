# [PROJECT NAME]

## 🎯 Purpose / Why This Exists
[Describe the main goal — the outcome, not the solution.]

Example:
Enable small teams to collaborate on projects with clear task ownership,
reducing meeting overhead and improving delivery predictability.

## 👤 Target Users
[Who will use this? Roles, demographics, needs.]

Example:
- Project Managers: Need visibility into team capacity and progress
- Software Engineers: Need clear task assignments without excessive admin
- Team Leads: Need to distribute work fairly and track velocity

## 🤲 User Problem
[Explain what they are struggling with today.]

Example:
Teams currently juggle multiple tools (Slack, email, spreadsheets) to track work.
This creates confusion about priorities, duplicated effort, and lost context.
No single source of truth exists for "what needs to be done and by whom."

## 🏆 Success Metrics / KPIs
[List specific, measurable goals]

Example:
- Reduce onboarding friction for new team members (< 10 min to first task)
- Users can create and assign a task in < 2 minutes
- Must score ≥95 Lighthouse accessibility
- Must score ≥90 Lighthouse performance
- Task completion rate increases by 20% within first month
- 80%+ user satisfaction score

## 💡 Functional Requirements
[List all required capabilities as bullet points]

Example:
- User authentication (email/password and OAuth providers)
- Create, read, update, delete tasks
- Assign tasks to team members
- Set due dates and priority levels
- Task status workflow (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- Task comments and activity history
- File attachments on tasks
- Search and filter tasks
- Dashboard with task overview
- Email notifications for assignments
- Real-time updates when tasks change

## 💭 Nice-to-Haves (Not Mandatory)
[List optional enhancements]

Example:
- Task templates for recurring work
- Time tracking per task
- Sprint/milestone grouping
- Gantt chart visualization
- Mobile app (PWA)
- Slack integration
- Calendar view
- Bulk task operations
- Custom fields per workspace

## ⚙ System Constraints
[Technical or operational constraints]

Default (automatically included):
- Must use Next.js + Node + Prisma + PostgreSQL
- Must use secure authentication (NextAuth)
- Must support local hosting

Additional examples:
- Must work offline for viewing cached data
- Must support 1000+ concurrent users
- Must integrate with existing SSO system
- Data must be stored in EU region only
- Must be deployable to AWS
- Maximum page load time: 2 seconds

## 🔐 Security Requirements
[Security specifications]

Example:
- Hashed passwords (bcrypt or better)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- MFA support (TOTP)
- Session timeout after 30 minutes inactivity
- Audit log for sensitive actions
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Input sanitization and XSS prevention
- CSRF protection
- Secure password reset flow
- Data encryption at rest

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Requirements
[Testing and quality standards]

Default (automatically included):
- 100% critical-path coverage
- E2E tests via Playwright
- Must meet WCAG 2.1 AA
- Test coverage >80%

Additional examples:
- Load testing for 100 concurrent users
- Browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- API performance tests (<200ms response time)
- Security penetration testing checklist

## 📦 Output Expectations
[What the crew should deliver]

The crew should deliver:
- Complete project structure following Next.js best practices
- Full code implementation with TypeScript
- Comprehensive documentation (README, API docs, setup guides)
- Test coverage (unit, integration, E2E)
- Quality reports (accessibility, performance, security)
- Deployment configuration (Docker, CI/CD)
- Report on architectural decisions and tradeoffs

## ❓ Open Questions (Crew Should Resolve)
[List anything unclear or unknown]

Example:
- Should we support multiple workspaces per user?
- What's the expected data retention policy?
- Should task history be immutable or editable?
- What's the maximum number of team members per project?
- Should we support guest users (view-only access)?
- What's the preferred OAuth provider (Google, GitHub, Microsoft)?
- Should notifications be real-time (WebSocket) or polling?

## 🛠️ Technical Stack (Pre-defined)
- Frontend: Next.js 14+ (App Router, React Server Components)
- Backend: Node.js (API Routes, Server Actions)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- ORM: Prisma
- Authentication: NextAuth.js
- Testing: Jest + Playwright
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Containerization: Docker + Docker Compose
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
