# Simple Task Manager

## Purpose / Why This Exists
Build a simple task management system to help users organize their daily tasks

## Target Users
Individual users who need to track personal tasks

## User Problem
Users struggle to keep track of their daily tasks and forget important items

## Success Metrics / KPIs
- Users can add a task in < 10 seconds
- Task list loads in < 500ms
- 100% uptime

## Functional Requirements
- User authentication (sign up, login, logout)
- Create, read, update, delete tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Filter tasks by status

## Nice-to-Haves (Not Mandatory)
- Task categories/tags
- Due dates for tasks
- Priority levels

## System Constraints
- Must use Next.js + Node + Prisma + PostgreSQL
- Must use secure authentication (NextAuth)
- Must support local hosting

## Security Requirements
- Hashed passwords
- Secure session management
- Input validation

## Testing & Quality Requirements
- 100% critical-path coverage
- E2E tests via Playwright
- Must meet WCAG 2.1 AA
- Test coverage >80%

## Output Expectations
The crew should deliver:
- Complete project structure following Next.js best practices
- Full code implementation with TypeScript
- Comprehensive documentation (README, API docs, setup guides)
- Test coverage (unit, integration, E2E)
- Quality reports (accessibility, performance, security)
- Deployment configuration (Docker, CI/CD)
- Report on architectural decisions and tradeoffs

## Open Questions (Crew Should Resolve)
- Should tasks support sub-tasks?
- Should there be task sharing between users?

## Technical Stack (Pre-defined)
- Frontend: Next.js 14+ (App Router, React Server Components)
- Backend: Node.js (API Routes, Server Actions)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- ORM: Prisma
- Authentication: NextAuth.js
- Testing: Jest + Playwright
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Containerization: Docker + Docker Compose
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
